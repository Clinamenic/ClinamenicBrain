Proposal for Collaboration between DeSci World and CICM to create the DAO (RC-CICM) - Research Collective CICM

Dear President Mauricio Jessurun Solomou and council,

In this era of technological innovation and scientific advancement, the Colegio de Ingenieros Civiles de México (CICM) has consistently stood out for its commitment to excellence, research, and the professional development of its members. It is in this spirit of innovation and constant pursuit of improvement that I reach out to you to present a unique opportunity that we believe could mark the beginning of a new era for CICM and its participants: the adoption and participation in DeSci World as a Research Collective (RC).

Aligning with the 10 Strategic Objectives 2024-2026 of CICM, the proposed participation perfectly aligns with the WORK PROGRAM of the XL Directing Council.

The Research Collective CICM (RC-CICM) serves society by generating kEngrams (Knowledge) that generates more knowledge, which is the basis of human progress. All without borders, and in freedom and transparency.

To the membership, granting benefits that over time will gain value for their usability, their experiences, their benefits, and the value that the tokens they own.

Internally within CICM, positioning the College as an institution at the forefront, disruptive, visionary, and value-generating. Generating a potential income stream at no cost that both the college and the current founding council of the (RC-CICM) will receive their NFTs as founders of the DAO (RC-CICM).

7. Governance Model
Governance Structure Overview
The governance model of the LENR DAO is designed to be transparent, inclusive, and efficient, ensuring that all stakeholders have a voice in the direction and operations of the DAO. It operates on a decentralized basis, where token holders are granted governance rights, making them an integral part of the decision-making process. This structure supports a variety of activities, including but not limited to, electing leadership roles, directing research focus, allocating funds, and amending the governance framework itself.
Voting Mechanisms and Rights
Token-based Voting: Governance rights are directly tied to the holdings of the LENR DAO's native tokens. The more tokens a member holds, the greater their voting power. This mechanism ensures that those who are most invested in the DAO have a proportionate influence over its direction.
Delegated Voting: To facilitate active governance without requiring constant participation from all members, the DAO supports delegated voting. Token holders can delegate their voting rights to another member whom they trust to vote in alignment with their interests.
Quadratic Voting: For certain decisions, the DAO may employ quadratic voting, a method that allows members to allocate votes based on their preference intensity rather than a simple binary choice. This approach can provide a more nuanced understanding of the community's priorities.
Proposal and Decision-making Process
The proposal process is designed to be open and accessible, encouraging active participation from the community. It typically follows these steps:
Proposal Submission: Any token holder can submit a proposal for consideration by the community. Proposals can range from research projects needing funding to suggestions for improving the DAO's operations.
Community Discussion: Once submitted, proposals are open for discussion within the community. This period allows for feedback, revisions, and rallying support for the proposal.
Voting Period: After the discussion phase, proposals that meet predefined criteria move to a voting period where token holders cast their votes. The duration of the voting period and the criteria for a proposal's success (such as minimum participation levels and majority requirements) are predefined in the DAO's governance protocols.
Implementation: Proposals that successfully pass the voting stage are implemented. The DAO's smart contracts can automate parts of this process, such as the distribution of funds for approved research projects.
Community Engagement and Participation
Active community engagement is vital for the health and success of the DAO. The governance model encourages participation through several avenues:
Education and Onboarding: Resources and programs to educate members about LENR research and the DAO's operations, ensuring informed participation.
Incentives for Participation: Beyond voting, the DAO encourages active community involvement through forums, workshops, and collaborative projects. Contributions such as providing valuable feedback, moderating discussions, and leading community initiatives are recognized and rewarded.
Transparency and Open Communication: Regular updates, transparent reporting, and open channels for communication ensure that all members are informed about the DAO's activities and can contribute to its direction and success.

Governance Participation: Active participation in governance is encouraged through voting rights and potential rewards for engaged community members, ensuring a vibrant and participatory ecosystem.
Token Burn and Buy-back Mechanisms
RT Burn Mechanism: Introduce a token burn mechanism for RT, where a percentage of tokens used for funding research projects are burned. This can help control inflation and increase the token's scarcity over time, potentially raising its value.
GT Buy-back and Burn: Allocate a portion of DAO revenues (e.g., from licensing technologies developed through funded research) to buy back and burn GTs. This not only reduces the circulating supply, enhancing scarcity, but also returns value to token holders.
Scalability and Ecosystem Development
Partnership and Ecosystem Fund: Allocate RTs to a dedicated fund for establishing partnerships with academic institutions, industry players, and other DAOs. Collaborations can accelerate research progress, enhance the DAO's reputation, and expand the ecosystem.
Open Innovation Platform: Consider developing an open platform funded by RTs where researchers worldwide can submit LENR-related problems or ideas, and the community can collaboratively propose solutions or projects. This can foster innovation and leverage the collective intelligence of the LENR community.
Economic Model and Sustainability
The tokenomics model of the LENR DAO is designed for long-term sustainability, with mechanisms in place to support ongoing research, development, and ecosystem growth:
Transaction Fees: A small fee on transactions within the ecosystem can provide ongoing funding for research projects and operational costs.
Inflation/Deflation Mechanisms: Thoughtful control of the token supply, through mechanisms such as token burning or issuance, can ensure economic stability and value appreciation over time.
Staking and Yield Farming: Offering opportunities for token holders to earn rewards through staking or participating in liquidity pools can enhance token utility and encourage long-term holding.
The tokenomics and incentive structures of the LENR DAO are crafted to align the interests of all participants with the overarching goal of advancing LENR research and development. By providing clear utility, fair distribution, and strong incentives for contribution and governance participation, the DAO aims to create a robust and sustainable ecosystem dedicated to unlocking the potential of LENR technology for a cleaner and more energy-abundant future.

6. Tokenomics and Incentive Structures
LENR DAO Token Utility and Features
Governance Token GTs (LENG) “Low Energy Nuclear Governance”
Max Supply: The total supply of GTs should reflect the need for a manageable yet sufficiently decentralized governance structure. Given the specialized domain, a smaller max supply could still ensure meaningful participation. Consider something in the range of 1 million to 10 million GTs, which allows for granularity in distribution while preventing excessive dilution of individual voting power.
Initial Airdrop and Launch: Aim for an initial circulating supply that activates the community without saturating the market. Distributing 10-20% of the max supply at launch could encourage early participation while retaining tokens for future incentives and community growth.
Distribution Strategy:
Airdrop to early contributors and community members who have significantly engaged with the DAO pre-launch.
Allocate a portion for public sale to raise funds and increase token distribution.
Reserve a significant share for future rewards, partnerships, and community initiatives to ensure long-term engagement.
GT Voting Power Balance
Time-locked Staking for Enhanced Voting Power: Encourage long-term holding and participation in governance by offering enhanced voting power for GTs that are staked for longer periods. This can help stabilize governance participation and align stakeholders with the long-term vision of the DAO.
Decay Mechanism for Voting Power: Implement a decay mechanism where the influence of GTs on voting decreases unless actively used for governance or staked. This encourages active participation and prevents dormancy in governance.
Research Token RTs (LENR) “Low Energy Nuclear Research”
Max Supply: Being variable, LENRs max supply is variable and has mechanisms to prevent hyperinflation based on the DAO’s vote. Implement caps on annual token creation or tie minting to specific, quantifiable achievements within the research community.
Initial Distribution: We will start with a modest issuance to fund early-stage projects, with an initial mint of 100,000 LENRs, focusing on immediate research and DAO needs and establishing the token's value.
Distribution Strategy:
Direct grants to laboratories and researchers for approved projects, with tokens released according to project milestones.
Community rewards for contributions such as peer review, project proposals, and other supportive activities.
A portion could be set aside for liquidity provisions, ensuring the token's exchangeability on platforms.
Dynamic Funding Mechanisms for RT
Research Milestone Fund Release: Implement a smart contract system that releases funding in stages based on the achievement of predefined research milestones. This ensures that tokens are allocated efficiently and effectively, rewarding progress and successful outcomes.
Matching Funds Model: Introduce a matching funds model where the DAO matches RT tokens for external funding received by research projects. This can encourage external investment in LENR research and increase the value and utility of RT.

Ideas to test for improvements in hallucinations

Without references:

- Have a list of question-answer pairs from our own brain (I don't think it makes sense to test in data that has probably been used by OpenAI, etc). Run the same embedding-model setup with Python and loop through all the Q-A to get an accuracy score.

Using paths or references to the origin of the context/data when giving responses:

- If the AI provides a link, path or reference to where it got the answer from (or what it built it from), we could check if the answer is correct and if the reference is correct. This would give us two different scores and I think references are going to be very important for PoK. The current implementation in Obsidian does not return references.

To the esteemed members of the CICM Board,

As we delve deeper into potential collaborations with DeSci World, particularly in the creation and utilization of kEngrams, it is paramount to ensure these digital knowledge units not only align with our organizational values but also uphold our reputation for accuracy and integrity. Herein, I provide an overview of how kEngrams are created and the measures we can take to safeguard against bias, misinformation, and potential reputational risks.

**Creation of kEngrams:**
kEngrams, or knowledge Engrams, are structured units of knowledge optimized for artificial intelligence readability and interoperability within the decentralized science (DeSci) ecosystem. The creation process involves several key steps:

1. **Knowledge Submission**: Individuals—whether researchers, engineers, or domain experts—initiate the process by submitting a piece of knowledge. This could be research findings, engineering data, or professional insights relevant to our field.

2. **Formatting and Structuring**: Once submitted, this knowledge is formatted and structured into a standardized digital object—the kEngram. This step is crucial as it involves encoding the information in a way that is both machine-readable and aligned with the DeSci protocols for data integrity and consistency.

3. **On-chain Attestation**: The kEngram is then attested on the blockchain. This involves verifying the accuracy and origin of the information, thus creating an immutable record of the knowledge unit. This record is critical for maintaining transparency and traceability.

4. **Interoperability Checks**: To ensure the kEngram can be effectively integrated and utilized across different platforms and projects within the DeSci ecosystem, it undergoes interoperability checks. This ensures that the knowledge can be accessed and employed in diverse applications without compatibility issues.

**Safeguarding Against Bias and Misinformation:**
To protect against the risks of biased or inaccurate information and to safeguard the CICM’s reputation, we can implement several strategies:

1. **Peer Review and Validation**: Before any knowledge submission is converted into a kEngram, it should undergo a rigorous peer review process. This could involve panels of both internal and external experts who evaluate the content for accuracy, relevance, and potential bias.

2. **Blockchain Transparency**: The use of blockchain technology ensures that each step in the creation and utilization of kEngrams is recorded and transparent. This allows for audit trails that can trace any piece of knowledge back to its origin, ensuring accountability and the ability to address any discrepancies or issues swiftly.

***

**Forwarded from [Luis Maumejean](https://t.me/Phygital_Integrator)**

3. **Ethical Standards and Guidelines**: Establishing a set of ethical standards and guidelines for knowledge creation and submission is crucial. These standards should be aligned with our organizational values and the ethical norms of our profession, ensuring that all contributions are scrutinized for ethical implications and societal impact.

4. **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback**: Implementing a system for continuous monitoring and feedback allows for the dynamic assessment of kEngrams in use. This system can flag potential issues, such as emerging biases or inaccuracies, enabling timely interventions.

5. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Regularly engaging with all stakeholders, including the engineering community, academia, and industry partners, helps to maintain a broad perspective and mitigate the risks of insular or biased knowledge creation.

In conclusion, while the potential for innovation and knowledge sharing through kEngrams is vast, it is imperative that we approach this collaboration with diligence and a robust framework for quality and integrity. By instituting rigorous creation processes and safeguard measures, we can ensure that the kEngrams not only enhance our capabilities but also reflect the high standards and esteemed reputation of the CICM.

Respectfully,
