# Workflow DSW

_**Workflow:** **way to automate tasks or activities that are part of the business processes**. Fundamentally, it's about the information passing between the different participants of the process following some predefined rules._

**Notion vs Obsidian:** The biggest difference is what I want to keep forever (Obsidian) and what I don't (Notion or other systems)

### Notion

---

- **Tool** Management
- The interface is more user-friendly and intuitive than Obsidian, especially for those without programming knowledge.
- Since data is stored in the cloud, users can access it from anywhere.
- It is better suited for business management or workgroups of more than 10 people.
- The workflow is simpler as it includes standard functionalities.
- Relational databases
- It excels in task and project management. For example, a CRM cannot be done in Obsidian, and if it can it is overcomplicating a task that can be easily done in other tools.
- The organization of projects and documents is easily done here
- Custom tools can be created that adapt to each work team
- Less is more
- Integrations with different tools, which can be managed in Notion
- Notion is the best for managing knowledge and tools between several people
- Idea management through tools
- Reduces the barrier to entry for people who are not familiar with this type of systems
- For non-technical users

[Notion and ClickUp](https://www.notion.so/Notion-and-ClickUp-24733ceccba64db687b7fac3048e5a0f?pvs=21)

### Obsidian

---

- **Knowledge** Management
- There is an entry barrier due to its modular programming
- Functionality can be added through plugins
- It's not efficient for task management
- Non-relational databases can be integrated through plugins
- In the Obsidian system, items that should be preserved and tracked over time, in other words, **knowledge**, should be **stored**. For instance, ideas, bibliographic data, etc. From there, other tools like Linear, Airtable, Notion, etc., can be utilized to avoid overwhelming the Obsidian system.
- Obsidian has a limitation that could impact a team, the maximum number of collaborators is 10 and the maximum size of attached files is 200MB.
- **The 'brain' of Obsidian is something I want to maintain for life**. Do I want to keep track of the tasks each person has been working on, or do I want to preserve the result of that work, meaning the knowledge?
- In 20 years, will it be important for me to see in the 'brain' what a certain person was working on February 20th, 2024, or would I rather see the result of that work stored in the 'brain'?
- **A digital brain is a lifelong asset**
- Management can be done through internal diaries, however, by not having a reminder, we would fall into the same problem of not using the tools
- Through AI, approaches or conclusions can be created to better understand the information
- You can also build tools from Obsidian but it is much easier in Notion
- Much better to carry a Zettelkasten system
- Easy use for technical users
- This has offline mode

### **Linear vs Notion/ClickUp**

- This is a good system for tracking **tasks**. A task should be executable and once it's done, I don't need to think about it anymore. I just want to keep a record without cluttering my Obsidian system.
- Linear provides simplicity, clarity, and a direct focus on executing tasks in a sequential order, offering a clear and shared structure for tracking progress and assigning responsibilities. It's particularly useful for projects with specific milestones that require sequential completion.
- Task management through Notion and/or ClickUp offers flexibility to adapt to workflows, but Linear has less complexity.
- The primary focus is on the execution of tasks in a specific sequence.

**Task management**

- Linear= Software development and follows an [agile methodology](https://www.apm.org.uk/resources/find-a-resource/agile-project-management/)
- ClickUp= More versatile tool that can adapt to a wide range of teams and use cases
- Notion= Flexibility and customization capability

---

### **Airtable vs Notion/ClickUp**

- This platform offers scalable and collaborative **databases**, with the significant advantage of complex automation.
- Airtable is specifically designed for database management, hence it provides a more sturdy database structure compared to Notion. It features a variety of field types, table relationships, and data validation capabilities.
- Airtable offers a more traditional database structure with an interface specifically designed for database management. On the other hand, Notion provides much greater flexibility in its database structure and a multifunctional interface that can adapt to a variety of use cases. The choice between Airtable and Notion will depend on the specific needs of the project.
- Airtable is better suited for flexible and customizable data management, while ClickUp is perfect for project and task management within a more defined structure.

### Telegram

---

Personal chat as well as big public groups and channels about different interests.

Telegram has features like:

- Cloud-based messaging
- Large group chats and channels

Telegram doesn't have as many integration options but does support bots that can do various tasks

Telegram is used by communities who want secure messaging with lots of features

Telegram is known for versatile messaging for both personal and group communication

### Slack

---

Professional team communication and collaboration. It's good for organizing talk about topics, projects, or teams.

Slack has features like:

- Channels (organized conversations)
- Direct messaging
- File sharing
- Integration with other apps
- Search functionality
- Customizable notifications It's famous for integrating with productivity tools

Slack lets you add tools like Google Drive, Notion, Linear, and more into your workspace.

Slack is mostly used by businesses, organizations, and teams for internal communication and collaboration.

Slack is better for professional collaboration and teamwork

**Slack is more useful for internal communication and integration, but Telegram is more versatile. Whatever is chosen depends on the needs as a team and the willingness to use the selected tool.**

1. The tools available are not being utilized effectively.
2. There is a lack of clear workflow definition.
3. Unwillingness to effectively provide feedback and execute action items among team members.
4. It is not necessary to use only one tool to do everything, different systems offer different advantages, the important thing is to make the workflow simpler and more efficient for all team members </aside>

<aside> <img src="/icons/reorder_gray.svg" alt="/icons/reorder_gray.svg" width="40px" /> **Conclusions**

- Obsidian is not a substitute for tools like linear, Notion or Airtable, especially for project and task management. Instead, it offers different functionalities designed for knowledge management.
- We plan to continue using Notion as our project management system. This includes managing specific databases related to a project, schedules, tasks (linked through Linear but stored in Notion), document organization, key storage, directories, and CRM. Some databases will be linked through Airtable depending on the number of records required and functionalities such as forms and automation. There is no need to use AI to identify what each individual works on; that's what records and filters are for.
- For knowledge storage, like meeting notes and ideas, we will use Obsidian via the [**Zettelkasten system**](https://obsidian.rocks/getting-started-with-zettelkasten-in-obsidian/) (**For more information click on the link**) Any project results that generate knowledge will also be uploaded to Obsidian.
- Once the new workflow is defined, it's essential for each team member to use the designated systems. Without this, it's impossible to execute any workflow.
- After defining the workflow, we will conduct a meeting to familiarize all team members with the new flow. A document will be provided, explaining how to store each item.
- It is necessary to improve communication between team members, the willingness to respond to messages, offer feedback, etc., to improve as a team and obtain better results

<aside> <img src="/icons/reorder_gray.svg" alt="/icons/reorder_gray.svg" width="40px" /> **Action Items**

1. Redefine the workflow, which includes specifying the tools to be used for particular tasks.
2. Redesign the templates and specific workflows for each application, including Obsidian. Before designing the template, it's necessary to define the type of information that will be stored in the 'brain' and who will be in charge.
3. Design a document (led by Paula) that specifies the workflow and all the details needed to execute it, including the roles of each team.
4. This document will be uploaded to Obsidian's 'brain' as it represents knowledge about DeSciWorld's operations, but it will also be stored in Notion and/or Drive for easy organization.
5. Conduct a meeting with all team members to introduce this new workflow and address any questions or potential improvements. </aside>
