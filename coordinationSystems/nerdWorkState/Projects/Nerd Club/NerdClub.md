#### Composability and Granularity in Pricing

One of the standout features of this model is its composability and the granularity in pricing it offers. By employing NFTs for subscriptions, users can enjoy a one-time subscription purchase that they can resell, providing a level of flexibility and control over their subscription not typically available in traditional models. Furthermore, the cost per query can be adjusted more closely to the actual compute cost, offering a more efficient and equitable pricing structure. This is made possible through the integration with Farcaster's Frames, which allows for the creation of interactive and authenticated experiences, such as accessing specific AI services on a per-use basis.

#### Integration with Farcaster and Utilization of Frames

The project's integration with Farcaster's decentralized infrastructure is key to its functionality. By leveraging Farcaster's Frames, the project can offer interactive AI services within the Farcaster ecosystem. Frames, as defined in the Farcaster documentation, are a standard for creating interactive and authenticated experiences. This technology enables the project to extend the OpenGraph standard, turning static embeds into interactive experiences that are perfect for delivering AI services in an engaging and user-friendly manner.

#### Benefits and Challenges

The benefits of this NFT-based subscription model are manifold, including enhanced security, ownership transparency, the potential for secondary markets, and immutable access rights. However, the project also faces challenges such as scalability, user experience, and regulatory compliance. These challenges are addressed through innovative solutions like optimizing smart contract efficiency and enhancing UI/UX with the Frog framework, ensuring a seamless and compliant user experience.
