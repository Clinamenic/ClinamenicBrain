And how to resolve it? I would like to use a regex to solve the problem.[/INST] \n\nThe issue you are facing is due to the order of operations in your regular expression. In JavaScript, `+` is a special character representing one or more occurrences, so it's being interpreted as \"one or more\" instead of \"multiple\".\n\nTo fix this, you can use the regex `/\\s+/g` which matches any whitespace character (including spaces, tabs, etc.). This will replace multiple spaces with a single space. Here is your updated code:\n\n```javascript\nconst string = 'Hello       World';\nconst newString = string.replace(/\\s+/g, \" \");\nconsole.log(newString); // Outputs Hello World\n```\nThis will correctly replace multiple spaces between words with a single space in any string.
