Just feels like there‚Äôs a bunch of interesting use cases for a uniswap style factory for tokens n things

Plan del dia: 

- Familarizarme m√°s con frog de forma estructurada, y testear la mierda que hice
- Familiarizarme con frames.js, ya que estaremos trabajando con esa baina
- Empezar a mirar sobre Index, para saber como funciona la data ah√≠

Okay new idea im making. Essentially Gamified Staking using our current pool contracts with some modifications.

The idea is fairly simple. Make a factory that deploys big bad Bosses, which are erc20 staking pool contracts, with set rewards, duration, and Health Points. 

Users then can do the following: 
-Join the fight by depositing, 
-Attack the boss by claiming
-Run Away from the fight by withdrawing. 

Attacking can be modified by owning one of our 404 Character Tokens. 

The goal is simple though, kill the boss before the Timeframe runs out. If you do, you get to claim your staked tokens, the staking rewards, and also, your portion of our 404 token that will be required to make a Boss. 
(could also potentially claim a poap, logic is tbd on that)

Why? To make staking more fun

Potential name is going to be UniBoss.

Alot of TODO's still but I think it could catch on...maybe.

If you lose, the boss wins, you can still claim your tokens, but the 404 token required to make the Boss would be sent back to the 404 treasury.

Potential name is going to be UniBoss.

Alot of TODO's still but I think it could catch on...maybe.

Quasi-Clients
It's clear to me that the future of Farcaster depends on the rapid (but not too rapid) proliferation of alt clients to help people better consume the increasingly varied content casted on the Farcaster protocol.
It's also clear to me that alt Farcaster clients are not venture scale and, to be honest, I am probably going to continue to assume this until DMs are in the protocol AND I see a16z explicitly fund an alt Farcaster client.
But in our bubbling cauldron of transaction frames, cast actions, and content there IS monstrous opportunity.
It's just not in the straightforward "make a decentralized 'Insert Existing FAANG app here' with Farcaster" scenario that is easy to imagine.
I think the monstrous opportunity is in a class of apps previously unexplorable in the past 15 years of closed ecosystems that I call "Quasi-Clients"
Quasi-Clients won't actually be apps themselves, at least not at first.
They'll be neat code bundles that make your Warpcast experience a little bit better.
One will streamline your bookmarks or help organize your FC relationships, another will stack rank your casts to speed up your creation flow, and one will definitely let you drop poop emojis on your friends in a fun little external leaderboard that you only visit a few times a day but you can also view in a frame.
Quasi-Clients will gain DAUs because they're useful in the specific ways that Farcasters need them to be.
And seemingly overnight they'll be 10x more useful with only a button or 2 more than when you installed it.
Then, and only then, with 1K+ DAU users, will they ship a client.
Except when they do, it'll be to create something that CAN'T be done with Warpcast alone, all their users' data will carry over seamlessly, and everyone will simply log into it with Farcaster so they'll be running hot in <2 minutes

< the AI should be leading the conversation, giving tasks to people that are best suited to perform those tasks or most interested in those tasks

The trick is here, that if they dont share enough they wont get represented, if they overshare, they'll get over represented in the context

Its easier to ask the AI to structure its response than to ask the people to structure their responses

We proceed with the meat of the session with other preplanned topics. During this time we ask the participants to make notes, including what is being spoken about, what their thoughts are, what they want to see as next steps

> lets create a shared objective here. Based on what you all like, e.g. how can we bring DeSci to more people. We can ask AI to suggest some common topics

cold dm'ed a gambling site (metawin.com) they're doing an airdrop for consistent users (token's MWIN) asked them if they wanted to contract out their staking pools or if they were going to offer them at all, and if so that we could do it fairly quickly.

### Internal Newsletter: Week 001 Update

---

#### **Highlights of the Week: Proof of Knowledge (PoK) and DeSci World Initiatives**

This week has been bustling with activities, focusing on the advancement of Proof of Knowledge (PoK) and the development of the decentralized science world (DeSci World). Here's a comprehensive summary of our key activities, discussions, and strategic moves.

---

### **Proof of Knowledge (PoK) Developments**

- **Zettlekasten Method Integration:** Eneko Uru√±uela has proposed integrating the Zettlekasten method into our PoK system to enhance performance. This method, known for improving knowledge management and synthesis, could significantly benefit our AI's ability to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses by prioritizing synthesized knowledge over entire documents.

- **Hallucination Testing:** Eneko has also initiated research on hallucination testing across different models. This effort aims to refine our AI's accuracy, ensuring it provides reliable and verifiable information, a crucial aspect of our PoK framework.

- **Obsidian for Organization:** A workshop led by At0x discussed the potential of using Obsidian for internal organization. The team deliberated on the advantages and challenges of this approach, agreeing to create a daily report channel to streamline communication and project tracking.

---

### **DeSci World Initiatives**

- **Grant Template Creation:** Rodo Trit√∂n has sketched a comprehensive grant template for Obsidian, outlining essential components like problem description, solution proposal, and impact assessment. This template will streamline our grant application process, ensuring clarity and consistency in our proposals.

- **DeSci World and CICM Collaboration:** Luis Maumejean presented a proposal for collaboration between DeSci World and CICM to create the DAO (RC-CICM). This initiative aims to position CICM at the forefront of technological innovation, leveraging DeSci principles to foster knowledge generation and community benefits.

- **LENR DAO Developments:** Diadon has been identified as the lead for the LENR DAO, focusing on building a structure to support Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) research. Despite facing challenges in rallying initial interest within the www.ISCMNS.org community, Diadon is committed to spearheading this transformative project.

- **Governance and Funding Strategies:** Discussions around governance models and funding strategies have been pivotal. An≈æe M. | Mickey has explored the use of MakerDAO's endgame smart contracts for subDAOs, emphasizing the need for a robust governance framework to support our initiatives.

---

### **Operational Updates**

- **Obsidian Integration:** The team is exploring the use of Obsidian to enhance our internal knowledge management system. This tool's potential to return references and organize information efficiently could significantly benefit our project coordination efforts.

- **Community Engagement:** Josh has emphasized the importance of forwarding relevant information to the BRAINZZZ channel. This initiative aims to enrich our data vault with diverse inputs, enhancing the AI's learning and our project's overall development.

---

### **Looking Ahead**

As we move forward, our focus remains on refining our PoK framework, expanding the DeSci World ecosystem, and ensuring our projects align with our mission to revolutionize the scientific research landscape. The integration of advanced methodologies, strategic collaborations, and a commitment to open knowledge and innovation underpins our efforts to achieve these goals.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to push the boundaries of decentralized science and knowledge sharing.
