### Internal Newsletter: Week 001 Update

---

#### **Highlights of the Week: Proof of Knowledge (PoK) and DeSci World Initiatives**

This week has been bustling with activities, focusing on the advancement of Proof of Knowledge (PoK) and the development of the decentralized science world (DeSci World). Here's a comprehensive summary of our key activities, discussions, and strategic moves.

---

### **Proof of Knowledge (PoK) Developments**

- **Zettlekasten Method Integration:** Eneko Uru√±uela has proposed integrating the Zettlekasten method into our PoK system to enhance performance. This method, known for improving knowledge management and synthesis, could significantly benefit our AI's ability to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses by prioritizing synthesized knowledge over entire documents.

- **Hallucination Testing:** Eneko has also initiated research on hallucination testing across different models. This effort aims to refine our AI's accuracy, ensuring it provides reliable and verifiable information, a crucial aspect of our PoK framework.

- **Obsidian for Organization:** A workshop led by At0x discussed the potential of using Obsidian for internal organization. The team deliberated on the advantages and challenges of this approach, agreeing to create a daily report channel to streamline communication and project tracking.

---

### **DeSci World Initiatives**

- **Grant Template Creation:** Rodo Trit√∂n has sketched a comprehensive grant template for Obsidian, outlining essential components like problem description, solution proposal, and impact assessment. This template will streamline our grant application process, ensuring clarity and consistency in our proposals.

- **DeSci World and CICM Collaboration:** Luis Maumejean presented a proposal for collaboration between DeSci World and CICM to create the DAO (RC-CICM). This initiative aims to position CICM at the forefront of technological innovation, leveraging DeSci principles to foster knowledge generation and community benefits.

- **LENR DAO Developments:** Diadon has been identified as the lead for the LENR DAO, focusing on building a structure to support Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) research. Despite facing challenges in rallying initial interest within the www.ISCMNS.org community, Diadon is committed to spearheading this transformative project.

- **Governance and Funding Strategies:** Discussions around governance models and funding strategies have been pivotal. An≈æe M. | Mickey has explored the use of MakerDAO's endgame smart contracts for subDAOs, emphasizing the need for a robust governance framework to support our initiatives.

---

### **Operational Updates**

- **Obsidian Integration:** The team is exploring the use of Obsidian to enhance our internal knowledge management system. This tool's potential to return references and organize information efficiently could significantly benefit our project coordination efforts.

- **Community Engagement:** Josh has emphasized the importance of forwarding relevant information to the BRAINZZZ channel. This initiative aims to enrich our data vault with diverse inputs, enhancing the AI's learning and our project's overall development.

---

### **Looking Ahead**

As we move forward, our focus remains on refining our PoK framework, expanding the DeSci World ecosystem, and ensuring our projects align with our mission to revolutionize the scientific research landscape. The integration of advanced methodologies, strategic collaborations, and a commitment to open knowledge and innovation underpins our efforts to achieve these goals.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to push the boundaries of decentralized science and knowledge sharing.
