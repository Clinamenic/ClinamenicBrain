reviewing the options for governance, proposed makerdao as a more robust option 

we created a very high level description of actions that we want the daos and subdaos to perform to give mickey a sense of product requirements so he can research which are our best options to cover these 

nerdDAO:

Meeting with lemonade on monday 

haiku system progress to aggregate embeddings functionality

the wiki of what they have built  is being built on obsidian 

building interfaces on warpcaster with custom frames 

integrated the PoK route into cast actions 

lens is going to implement an integration with cast so what theyve built will be integratable in both lens and lemonade 

 engram index PoC called "tribes" in farcaster

Notes:  

Lots of craziness in meetings, we need to avoid this since it translates into inefficiency , we couldnt do an internal rundown today in the dev sesh because of this.
