obsidian does return references, force it by saying "based on my notes" and click on the eye button

🫡️️ **TASK** 

We're in the trial phase of using Obsidian Brains for coordination. Carlos @Plat0x_eth has kindly set up the bot in BRAINZZ that will consume information we forward there and attach it to a vault. Currently, its mostly his own data and we need to give it more diverse test data from each user (us).

So, we must:

1. Start forwarding messages of any relevance to DSW and our product, operations, BD etc. to the BRAINZZZ channel. 
2. Dont worry for the next few days about structure, just send information there
3. We will optimise structure in the coming week

Thank you!

This is why the zettlekasten method can improve the performance vs just using entire documents

I believe the AI can give better results if it weighs synthesized knowledge more than entire papers

I was wondering if you have already done something like this and have templates for it

My idea is to create a template for fleeting notes, literature notes, and permanent notes, so I can synthesize the list of papers I want to read re: reducing hallucinations

Hey NERDs, have you played with the zettlekasten method in the brain?

@Plat0x_eth @carlosdimatteo @Oakenshadow @rraigal we need to have a serious discussion about the requirements of RC infra. In particular regarding EthOS, we need to be in complete alignment on all of this for Solidant

We can have it a number of ways:

-> Front end the same staking contract from multiple sites
-> You can host the build farms on your site, we can work on ui improvements and whatnot 
->We can create a new contract for you guys to own with your custom settings
