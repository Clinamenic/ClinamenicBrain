Ideas to test for improvements in hallucinations

Without references:

- Have a list of question-answer pairs from our own brain (I don't think it makes sense to test in data that has probably been used by OpenAI, etc). Run the same embedding-model setup with Python and loop through all the Q-A to get an accuracy score.

Using paths or references to the origin of the context/data when giving responses:

- If the AI provides a link, path or reference to where it got the answer from (or what it built it from), we could check if the answer is correct and if the reference is correct. This would give us two different scores and I think references are going to be very important for PoK. The current implementation in Obsidian does not return references.
